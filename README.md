# Prestashop Sublime Text autocomplete package

Snippets for the most used Prestashop classes and methods. The "most used" is based on what I use the most.

Some methods does not output every optionnal arguments. Once again, it's based on my experience where I rarely need them.

## Installation

Clone the repo in the application's bundle directory.

On OS X you will find it here: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`. For the other os I don't know where it is but it's probably easy to find if you google around.
